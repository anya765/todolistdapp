# To do List Dapp Built on Blockchain

This todo list is powered by an Ethereum smart contract where you can add new to do items and check items off the todo list. The todo list app is helpful for learning how to read and write data from the blockchain and execute business logic tied into a front end for the actual function of the blockchain. 

To build this project, I used Ganache personal blockchain for testing, Node.js, the Truffle Framework which has tools to develop Ethereum smart contracts using the Solidity programming language, and Metamask Ethereum wallet to manage personal funds when connecting to the blockchain. 

In the future, using the basics of this simple ToDo List Dapp, I would like to work on building out a user friendly front end and making projects built on the blockchain accessible for users without the installation of multiple dependancies. 

For this project I used this tutorial: https://www.dappuniversity.com/articles/blockchain-app-tutorial. 

Dapp University has awesome tutorials and video walkthroughs that definately helped me gain a lot of fundamental knowledge about decentralized applications and the blockchain.
